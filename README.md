# Capstone_Base

This repository serves as the base code for the **XE401–XE402 Capstone Project**.

# Project Overview

* **Project Name:** MILDS  
* **Team Members:** CDTs Courville, Fuller, Medapati, Notaro, and Stoltzfus  

The goal of this project is to develop an application that enables Observer/Controllers (OCs) at the National Training Center (NTC) to analyze and leverage information more effectively. The application will integrate data from multiple sources and tools into a single, cohesive platform to streamline workflows and test maintainers and logisticians at training centers.
